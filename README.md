### Nice-to-haves (Reza)

If you have additional ideas, or ambitious goals that would be unlikely to achieve within the project timeline you can describe them here.

If your initial results are extremely promising and you have additional energy you can include these.

If your initial results are less promising you can use these alternative directions, possible experiments, animation ideas and plots to continue or understand.
